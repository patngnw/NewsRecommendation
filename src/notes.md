### Training Steps
- Prepare Training Data (done once only):
  - Convert the Behaviors data from the MIND dataset format into one used for training
  - For line in behaviors.tsv, we generate *one training sample* **per** positive item found
    - For each training sample, we randomly pick 4 (args.npratio) negative items from behaviors.tsv
- Analyze **News** in the **training** set
  - Loop thru all the news and generate the following dicts:
    - news: key=news_id, value=[list_of_title_tokens, cat, authorid, list_of_entities]
    - news_index: key=1-based idx, value=news_id
    - category_dict: key=1-based idx, value=cat_str
    - authorid_dict: key-1-based idx, value=authorid
    - entity_dict: key=1-based idx, value=entity_id
    - word_dict: key=1-based idx, value=unique word token
- Convert *analyzed* **News** to Numpy matrices
  - Loop thru all the news and generate the following Numpy matrices:
    - Note:
      - no. of rows == total no. of news + 1 (1 is for the unknown news during inference)
      - 1st row is for the unknown, 2nd row is for the 1st news, 3 row is for 2nd news, etc.
    - news_title: 
      - news_title: (no. of news + 1, args.num_words_title), value=idx on word token based on word_dict
      - news_category: (no. of news + 1, 1), value=idx of cat based on category_dict
      - news_authorid: (no. of news + 1, 1), value=idx of authorid based on authorid_dict
      - news_entity: (no. of news + 1, 1), value=idx of 1st entity based on entity_dict
- Combine all these matrices into a single one:
  - Shape = (no. of news + 1, 20 + 1 + 1 + 1)
  - Note:
    - args.num_words_title = 20
- Create a DataLoader (based on an iterable Dataset we create):
  - When retrieving one sample, our dataset will return the following:
    - user_feature (user *reading* history): (50, 23) (args.user_log_length=50)
    - log_mask: which items in user_feature are valid (others are just zeros due to length padding)
    - news_feature:
      - A mix of negative items and one positive item
      - Shape = (5, 23)
    - label: which row in news_features represents the positive item
